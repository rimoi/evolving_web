# Evolving Web

I created this small project as an illustrative example of my coding approach using Symfony.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to address a specific problem scenario. Imagine a situation where a user named SAM needs to populate his database using data from CSV files. To accomplish this, we have three CSV files that will be used to populate three distinct entities:

- Clustering Rules
- Fuel
- Segments

These files are located at the root of the project in the `Data` folder.

## Technical stack
This project has been created with the following technologies :
  - Symfony (5.4)
  - PHP 8.0

## Installing the Project Locally
### Prerequisites
- Symfony CLI
- PHP, MYSQL, and Composer installed

### To Install the Project
```bash
git clone 
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install 

# Create the .env.local.php file (remember to add your database connection credentials)
composer dump-env dev 

# Create the local database
bin/console doctrine:database:create

# Run the migration
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

# Load fixtures
bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load

# Start the Symfony server in the background
symfony serve:start -d
```

After completing the previous steps, visit:

http://127.0.0.1:8000

For logging in, you can use the following account generated by fixtures:


| login          | password |
|----------------|----------|
| admin@demo.fr  | admin    |


Once logged in, the interface should be empty initially!

To populate your database, execute the following command:

```bash
bin/console app:import-cluster
```

Now, return to the dashboard, and you should have more data ðŸ˜‰
